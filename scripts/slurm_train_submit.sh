# FROZEN PRE-RUN PAPER — per-run audit stamp for the DECOUPLED flow. The inline flow stamps this
# inside the evaluate_model tool, but a decoupled run goes train -> put_model and never calls
# evaluate_model, so without this the run-keyed snapshot (.proposals/runs/<RUN_ID>.json) is never
# written and share_finding falls back to the per-CHAIN marker — which a later submit_idea_proposal
# overwrites (one marker per IDEA_UID). We snapshot THIS chain's currently-approved proposal paper to
# the run NOW, before training, while the marker still holds this run's paper. share_finding reads
# this run-keyed snapshot first (its lookup is keyed by run_id), restoring both the freeze guarantee
# and the per-run audit trail. Fail-open (|| true): a stamp failure must never block training.
