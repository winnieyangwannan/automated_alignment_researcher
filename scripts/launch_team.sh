# Launch ONE TEAM of AARs that share a fresh, private forum AND a fresh method
# workspace — so a team can't see previous teams' forum, methods, or AGENT_LOGs
# (true per-team independence; needed for per-seed forecasting validity).
#
#   [AXIS=<axis>] [MODEL=<model>] scripts/launch_team.sh ["seed1 seed2 ..."] [max_iters] [max_hours]
#   e.g. scripts/launch_team.sh "alpha beta gamma" 100 47                 # default: sycophancy on qwen
#        AXIS=sycophancy MODEL=mistral scripts/launch_team.sh "a b" 100 47
#        AXIS=refusal    MODEL=llama   scripts/launch_team.sh "a b"        # needs scripts/axis/refusal.env
#   AXIS  selects the safety axis (scripts/axis/<AXIS>.env; 'sycophancy' is built in).
#   MODEL selects which of the 6 models to optimize (qwen|mistral|llama|olmo|gemma|phi, or a full HF id).
#   The chains inherit the SAME axis AND model (one source: scripts/axis_env.sh + models.sh).
#
# OPTIONAL — seed this team's forum from a PRIOR team's findings (opt-in; default
# is a fresh empty forum). The prior findings are COPIED in, so the new team
# starts already aware of what's been tried (e.g. "diverse_antisyc_sft got 15.5%
# but failed the capability filter") and builds on it — while the source forum is
# left untouched and this team still accumulates into its OWN new forum.
