# It is the per-submission counterpart of eval_worker.sh's inner loop: it loads the
# staged model, scores it against the LOCKED holdout, and writes the held-out-STRIPPED
# composite to SCORES_DIR. Spawned by eval_watcher.sh (one per submission) on --qos=low
# (uncapped; short job, so preemption just means the watcher resubmits this one rid).
# The original eval_worker.sh DAEMON is left intact as the fallback.
#
# Args: <run_id> [suite].  All dirs are env-honoring (default = the gemma queue/holdout),
# so a per-model team passes SUBMISSIONS_DIR/SCORES_DIR/HOLDOUT_DIR via the watcher's env.
