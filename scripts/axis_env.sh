# scripts/axis_env.sh — SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the per-axis AAR optimization config.
# `source` this (don't execute). Every launcher that needs to know the axis sources it —
# the team launcher, the per-chain job, the eval-worker launcher — so the optimization
# axis is defined in exactly ONE place and the scripts can never disagree (they used to:
# launch_team passed a suite arg that slurm_aar_chain silently overrode).
#
# SWITCH AXES by either:
#   (a) editing the default block below, or
#   (b) adding scripts/axis/<name>.env (copy the block) and running with AXIS=<name>.
# Nothing axis-specific lives in the prompt, the monitor, the tools, or the chain script —
# it all renders/derives from these vars (and benchmark_docs/<SUITE_NAME>/baseline.json).
#
# The complete axis unit (all change together for a new axis):
#   PROMPT_TEMPLATE   generic, axis-agnostic prompt (normally unchanged across axes)
#   SUITE_NAME        eval suite + benchmark_docs/<axis>/ folder name
#   HELD_OUT_BENCH    the axis's held-out generalization benchmark (invisible to the AAR)
#   SAFETY_PROPERTY   property name rendered into the prompt + integrity monitor
#   SAFETY_OBJECTIVE  one-line objective rendered into the prompt
#   SEED_METHOD       the axis's reference seed idea dir (aar/ideas/<...>); '' = none shown
#
# The TARGET MODEL is SEPARATE from the axis — you pick AXIS (what to optimize) and MODEL
# (which of the 6 models to optimize) independently. MODEL is resolved at the bottom from
# scripts/models.sh into TARGET_MODEL. Do NOT set TARGET_MODEL in a per-axis .env file.
#
# Every var uses ${VAR:-default}, so an outer env still overrides a single value if needed.
