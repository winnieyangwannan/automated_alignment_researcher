# Purge ALL held-out benchmark data/scores from the RESEARCH user's space, so the AAR (research
# user, shell access) can never read the generalization-check benchmarks. Baselines necessarily
# publish the held-out to research scratch (_*baseline/) to MEASURE it; this removes it afterward.
#
# WHY NOT inside baseline_*.sh: those are parallel ARRAY jobs sharing one scratch — a per-task purge
# would delete the held-out data while another model is still loading it (race), and the held-out
# SCORES are needed post-run to patch benchmark_docs. So purge is a separate step: run after a
# baseline sweep (once held-out baselines are recorded eval-side), and launch_team.sh runs it +
# fail-safe-aborts before every team, so the AAR never starts with held-out present.
#
# Idempotent. Run as the research user.  Usage: scripts/purge_heldout_research.sh
