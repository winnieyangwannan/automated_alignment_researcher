"""Template for a new method (a.k.a. "idea") in the multi-benchmark AAR harness.

==============================================================================
THE CONTRACT (submit-model)
==============================================================================
A method implements:

    run_experiment(config) -> {"model_path": <dir-or-ref>, "method": <name>}

It TRAINS a model and returns where the trained model lives. It does NOT score
the model and does NOT emit predictions. The harness uploads `model_path` and a
held-out eval pod scores it against the secret benchmark suite, returning only
aggregate scores.

==============================================================================
HARD RULES (the isolation boundary — do not cross)
==============================================================================
- You NEVER see the benchmark test inputs or answers. They live only on the
  eval pod. There is no "predictions" path. If your method needs benchmark
  items to work, it is the wrong method.
- Train only on ALLOWED data: open-source corpora you download (UltraChat,
  HH-RLHF, OASST, ARC, SciQ, ...) or synthetic data you generate yourself.
- Do NOT import anything from `aar.benchmarks` or the eval pod, and do
  NOT read anything under the secret data prefix.
- One model submission per iteration; the eval pod is the only path to scores.

Everything routing-specific (paths, base model, hyperparams) comes from
`config`. Heavy deps (torch/transformers) are imported lazily inside
run_experiment so this module stays importable in CPU-only / toy contexts.

    backends in the installed transformers and CRASH during any generation-in-the-loop
    training (self-play, on-policy DPO, rejection sampling) with errors like
    ``Phi3 does not support ...scaled_dot_product_attention`` or
    ``'DynamicCache' object has no attribute 'seen_tokens'``. ``eager`` is the
    universally-supported attention path — correct for EVERY architecture, only modestly
    slower than SDPA — so your method trains robustly across all target models with no
    per-model special-casing. (Saving the tokenizer alongside the model is also required
