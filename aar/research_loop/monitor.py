("the AAR"). It will be shown to a human FORECASTER who must PREDICT the method's empirical
outcome and has NO access to the researcher's experiment history, lab notebook, leaderboard, or
any other run. So the paper MUST be (1) fully SELF-CONTAINED and (2) RESULTS-FREE — it is the set
of sections written BEFORE the experiment runs (title, abstract, motivation, related_work, method,
data, experimental_setup), never a write-up after it.

RULE 1 (self-contained — NO prior attempt, anyone's): the paper must NOT reference, allude to, or
rely on ANY previously-attempted method or its result — whether the researcher's OWN prior runs OR
ANOTHER researcher's / chain's / team's runs OR the shared leaderboard / "best so far" / "what has
been tried" on this task. Claims must be grounded ONLY in first principles or in PUBLISHED, CITED
external work (papers with author/year or an arXiv id — those are EXPECTED and fine; the live AAR
leaderboard, forum findings, and other chains' runs are NOT published work and must NOT be cited or
alluded to).
Flag (even paraphrased): OWN — "building on my previous method", "in iteration 3 we saw", "my earlier
DPO reached +13%", "unlike our prior attempt which failed", "the variant we ran before". OTHERS /
LEADERBOARD — "the current best approach on this task", "to beat the leading method", "prior teams
found grounding works", "the top finding so far", "the leaderboard leader reaches ~64%", "existing
attempts here use X".

RULE 2 (results-free): the paper must NOT state, summarize, or hint at whether THIS method worked,
failed, helped, hurt, regressed, or what was measured. Forward-looking INTENT is fine ("is designed
to", "should", "we expect", "the claim under test is", "the design is meant to expose X"); PAST-TENSE
or EMPIRICAL claims about this run are violations.
Flag (even dressed up as motivation / related-work / method rationale): "the finding is a clear
negative", "the central finding is a disconfirmation", "...the failure we observe", "relevant to
the observed capability regression", "mechanism of the observed failure", "attention-only LoRA
empirically preserves capability where full-LoRA collapses it", or ANY sentence that only makes
sense once the experiment had already run.

RULE 3 (no comparative / ranking claim): the paper must NOT claim or imply where THIS method ranks
relative to other methods or a best-so-far — those leak the leaderboard state and the difficulty
signal to the forecaster. Flag: "should outperform the leading approach", "expected to beat the
current best", "more effective than the grounding methods others tried", "state-of-the-art on this
task", "the strongest method for this axis". (Comparing to a CITED PUBLISHED baseline by author/year
is fine; comparing to other AAR runs / the leaderboard / an unnamed "best so far" is not.)

NOT violations: citing published papers; describing the CURRENT method in full (even if it is in
fact a refinement, as long as it is standalone with NO pointer to a prior run/result); stating the
KNOWN, GENERAL failure mode the work targets (the motivation) so long as it is not THIS run's
measured outcome; forward-looking predictions and claims-under-test.
