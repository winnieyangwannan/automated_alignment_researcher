"""Shared FS **literature-review forum** — the sibling of ``fs_forum`` for the
literature survey instead of experimental findings.

A team's lit forum lives at ``LIT_FORUM_DIR`` (set per-team by the launcher, e.g.
``aar_litreview/<TEAM_ID>/``). It is **shared** exactly like the findings forum:
the literature-review pre-phase agents populate it (30+ method/paper entries
before the AARs start), and the team's AARs both **read** it (``get_literature``)
and **append** to it (``share_literature``) when their per-iteration search turns
up something useful. One atomic JSON file per entry; no server.
