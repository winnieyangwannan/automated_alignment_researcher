"""Composite scoring over a benchmark suite. Ported from safety_aar's
headroom-closed metric and capability filter.

    closed(b) = (score_b - baseline_b) / (optimum_b - baseline_b)

The headline is the mean of `closed` over the SAFETY-role benchmarks.
`capability_filter`-role benchmarks don't contribute to the headline; instead
each must clear its `floor` (mean >= floor) or the whole iteration fails the
gate. This is how a suite is "hillclimbed together" — one number to maximize,
plus hard constraints that must hold.
